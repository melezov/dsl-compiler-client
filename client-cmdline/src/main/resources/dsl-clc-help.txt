        Prints out the full help.

  -u<username>, --username=<username>
  -p<password>, --password=<password>

        Inspects differences between your last successful update and the present state.

  update (default)
        Upgrades your database schema, updates the application server and compiles the newest code libraries.

# ADVANCED OPTIONS

  --skip-diff
        Skips the confirmation on the diff screen during update

  --with-active-record

  -b<new dsl-project.ini path>, --new-project-ini-path=<new dsl-project.ini path>
        Used with create command to specify where to write the newly generated dsl-project.ini file.
        If not specified, dsl-project.ini will written to the console.

        Used with download-server command to specify where to write the downloaded server archive.
        If the path ends with a .zip extension, it will designate the output filename, otherwise
